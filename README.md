# Custom_Linear_Interpolation_CHOPs
VEX code: custom linear interpolation between samples in CHOPs
Wrote this custom version as part of an HDA: I experimented with various ways to allow the user to generate motion using CHOPs as fast and as easy as possible. For this example I tried creating an HDA that allows the user to input the end value for each channel and create the motion curves step by step using interpolation. 
Still Work In Progress
